                    In terms of the best thing I have read recently, I do not read often, however I read about different philosophers in BF190. BF190 as a whole, was a very interesting course. There I learned about a variety of philosophers and subjects pertaining to them.

                    During my time within this course, I read a variety of sources pertaining to those philosophers, which I found to be interesting and engaging. It was cool to compare and contrast the different ideologies and perspectives of different philosophers and apply it to a variety of themes.
